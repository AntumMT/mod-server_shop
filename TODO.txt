TODO:
- Security:
	- might be an issue if admin changes shop ID while player is using
- Functionality:
	- optimize how refunds are given (e.g. if there is no room for 50s, but room for 1s, then give out 1s instead)
- Aestethics:
	- make colorable with unifieddyes
	- fix stepping sound for "large" node
- Misc.:
	- store inventory contents in node/player meta in case of server crash/shutdown (buyer shops only)
	- make usable with "folks" mod
	- add player shops
	- fix so unknown items don't mess up shop (may become a problem when shops are registered live)
	- allow shops to be configured live
	- use a spinner to select custom amount (example in terraform: https://github.com/x2048/terraform/blob/4b36d36/init.lua#L316 )
	- support groups in buyer shops
	- fix shops from config being unregistered if the product list is empty
	- fix cannot right-click deposit into inventory multiple times (seller shops only)
