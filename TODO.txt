TODO:
- Security:
	- might be an issue if admin changes shop ID while player is using
- Functionality:
	- optimize how refunds are given (e.g. if there is no room for 50s, but room for 1s, then give out 1s instead)
	- allow any currency value, not just 1, 5, 10, 50, & 100
	- allow custom currency types for buyer shops
	- buyer shops: hold items in inventory & don't process until "sell" button pressed
- Visuals:
	- touch up textures
	- fix texture tiling
	- make 2 nodes high using mesh
- Misc.:
	- make usable with "folks" mod
	- add localization support
	- set shop name from formspec instead of registration so shops with different names can use same content
	- add player shops
	- fix so unknown items don't mess up shop (may become a problem when shops are registered live)
	- add chat command to reload shops file in world directory
	- allow shops to be configured live
	- register chat command "/server_shop" to register live
		- "/server_shop register <buyer>|<seller> <id>"
		- "/server_shop unregister <buyer>|<seller> <id>"
		- "/server_shop add <buyer>|<seller> <id> <item> <price>"
		- "/server_shop remove <buyer>|<seller> <id> <item>
		- "/server_shop reload"
